            <p>Welcome to a game with a meaningful purpose: protecting women from male species in the dating realm.
                In this game, flags are categorized based on historical data, adding an extra layer of security.
                For my personal retribution, some unique flags have been incorporated. So, dive in and enjoy the game to the fullest.</p>
            <p>This game is incredibly simple. Aim to evade as many red flags as you can while capturing the green ones.
                If your score falls below 0, the likelihood of dying alone in the end increases.</p>
